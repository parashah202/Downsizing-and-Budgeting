# Downsizing-and-Budgeting
Cleaning Raw Survey file from Bank of England and analyzing it using  Python, Tableau, PowerBI and Excel, Finally developing Machine Learning Algorithms to help predict the expenses categories for the households at the time of downsizing.

This project was a part of our group work where I created a high performance team of 5 people(including me) with people having varied skill set and different interest, It was a challenging task to combine ideologies of different people, but finally after facing several difficulties and overcoming them we scored distinction.

This repository is all about my individual contribution in the team.

My main aim for the project was to help people meet their new expenses in a sudden dropped income meet by rather forced or willingly downsizing. Several factors like Covid, Brexit, Taxes, Inlation, Retirement, Illness forces people to downsize and this sudden change is not easy to cope with.

With suing Excel and python I have helped team to clean a Raw survey file obtained from Bank of England Database which had 1400 Columns and 600+ questions. Investing much of the time on Data Cleaning we were finally able to obtain relevant data with around 70 questions and 200 columns. The Main challenge here was missing values (which were a lot). I used several methods like deletion, imutation with central tendency to overcome it. 

Finally I started with the analysis and visualization using Tableau, Excel and Python to make Dashboard and bring out some most needed insights. Here too Some Data Wrangling steps were followed to merge the postal code and old regions of England with the nuts value to according to new regions to accurately plot them on the map. 

lastly I used some suervsed machine learning algorithms to predict which households are likely to Budget their exenses based on certain Survey question and that was further took into pproduction for determining the expense categories and amount accordingly. 

For the final Presentation I used CANVA to build an MP4 file for deliverng a well rehersed script(written by me) which lead into a good impression on Jury, which gave us 80/100 in Our VIVA.

It was a wonderful experience where I learned many new things and build life-long friends.
